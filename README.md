### Hi there 👋

I am Slavo and I have a strong passion for **building sustainable software as well as building high-functioning engineering teams**, ideally at the same time.

***

Throughout my career, I have worked on a variety of projects across different industries (ad-tech, marketplaces, logistics, ...), but since around 2017 I have been involved almost exclusively in fin-tech 💸.

As part of [McKinsey Digital](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/how-we-help-clients), I have been helping clients in Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia build and successfully launch digital banks. With this experience, I have become somewhat of an expert in **modern cloud-native banking, payments and settlement systems**.

Beyond my passion for green ♻️ (cost and resource effective) software, scalable and resilient 💪 cloud-native architectures, and overall systems security 🔐, I also very much enjoy **building digital talent and culture**.

I am a huge open-source software proponent and in my spare time I author and contribute to a number of open-source projects.

Recently, I published [gRPC on Node.js with Buf and TypeScript](https://slavovojacek.medium.com/grpc-on-node-js-with-buf-and-typescript-part-1-5aad61bab03b) and I am hoping to publish more content in coming months.

As my name suggests, I'm originally from Slovakia 🇸🇰 but have been living and working (mostly) in London 🇬🇧 for nearly a decade now.

I love playing tennis 🎾.
