### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am Slavo and I have a strong passion for building sustainable software as well as building high-functioning engineering teams, ideally at the same time.

As my name suggests, I'm originally from Slovakia ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡° but have been living and working (mostly) in London ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ for nearly a decade now.
