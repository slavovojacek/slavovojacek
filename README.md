### Hi, my name is Slavo and I'm a software engineer with a passion for building innovative solutions to help solve complex and meaningful challenges.

I have over a decade of hands-on experience in the field, and have worked on a variety of projects including real-time delivery tracking, marketplaces, cloud-native banking, robo-advisory for wealth management applications, and more.

In my free time, I like to ✍️ articles, contribute to open-source projects, and build [tools that other engineers can use](https://github.com/sniptt-official/ots).

Recently, I have been involved in transforming the [McKinsey Digital blog](https://medium.com/@mckinseydigital) to become a place for practitioners to publish deeply technical content with minimal effort.

👋
