### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am Slavo and I specialise in building sustainable software and high-functioning engineering teams that help organisations realise the full potential of modern technology.

As part of McKinsey Digital, I have been helping clients in Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia build and successfully launch digital businesses at scale.

I am a huge open-source software proponent and in my spare time I author and contribute to a number of open-source projects.

As my name suggests I am originally from Slovakia ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡°, but have been living in London ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ for nearly a decade now.
